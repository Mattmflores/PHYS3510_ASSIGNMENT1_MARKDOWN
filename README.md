# Rigid Pendulum Behavior Under Driving Frequencies and Sudden Pivot Displacements

### 1.How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency (ω₀ = sqrt(g / L)) of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?

- Driving Frequency _Lower_ than Natural Frequency  
The pendulum follows the driving motion.
    
- Driving Frequency _Higher_ than Natural Frequency  
The pendulum will appear motionless.

### 2.If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?

The displacement angle will **increase**.

### 3.If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior?

The pendulum will fall faster with more energy.
